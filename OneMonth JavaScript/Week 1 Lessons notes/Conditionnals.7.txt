Often a computer program must make choices on which way to proceed. Conditional statements are features of a programming language which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.

Conditionals are in every programming language. They allow for different scenarios so that one piece of code can result in several different, customized results.
