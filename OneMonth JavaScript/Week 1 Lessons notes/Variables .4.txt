In programming, a variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. You can think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory, which can then be used throughout your program.

Variables - a value that can change, depending on conditions or information passed to the program.
