An array is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. In some programming languages, arrays can only hold values of the same type, but not in JavaScript. In JavaScript, you can have values of different types in the same array.

Arrays are lists of items, like strings or numbers. They make it easy to work with large sets of data.

We'll be working with an array of three different cars in this lesson, which looks like this:

var car = new Array("BMW", "Saab", "Maserati")
The first item in the list referred to as being in position zero, and counting up from there.

car[0] = "BMW"
car[1] = "Saab"
car[2] = "Maserati"j

		<script>
			/* this is an event */

			var username = prompt("Hello, who are you?");

			var car = new Array("BMW", "Saab", "Maserati");

			if(username==="Chris") {
				document.write("<h1>Hello " + username + " you won a " + car[1] + "!</h1>");
			}
			else {
				document.write("<h1>Hello " + username + "!");
			}
